# How I Met My Friend (Friend-Finder App)
This weeks assignment was to createa full-stack web application that uses Express to handle the routing of client-side requests.
​
## Overview: 

How I Met My Friend is a fun quiz that invites a user to answer a series of questions and compares them to other users of the app (preloaded How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) characters). The app will then match and display the name and picture of the character with the best compatibility.

## Getting Started:

* Please go to the following link: `https://friend-finder-25.herokuapp.com/` 
* Open the application and click on the 'Take Quiz' button.
* Complete the 10 quiz questions to prompt the modal to match you with the HIMYM character you have the most compatability with.
