# How I Met My Friend (Friend-Finder App)
This weeks assignment was to createa full-stack web application that uses Express to handle the routing of client-side requests.
​
## Overview: 

How I Met My Friend is a fun quiz that invites a user to answer a series of questions and compares them to other users of the app (preloaded How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) characters). The app will then match and display the name and picture of the character with the best compatibility.

## Getting Started:

* Please go to the following link: `https://friend-finder-25.herokuapp.com/` 
* Open the application and click on the 'Take Quiz' button.
* Complete the 10 quiz questions to prompt the modal to match you with the HIMYM character you have the most compatability with.

## App Example:

</a>

###### Please Note:
By clicking on the Maclaren's Friend Network link, you'll see all the characters (and the one created for the user). Clicking the the repo link will take you directly to the app.

## Technologies Used:
-   HTML
-   CSS
-	Javascript
-	Node.js
-	NPM packages:
    -	Express
    -   Path
-   Heroku
-   GitHub

#### Go to npmjs if you want to know more about:

1. **Express**:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
2. **Path**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/path

## Future Enhancements:
My first step would be to clean up the code and rounting structure within the files to more cleanly link the CSS and files. Next, I'd make enhancements around the modal - specifically, a better interface for the user when they receive their match and an auto reset on the form. Last, I'd like to enhance to friend network to include more friends for the user to conenct with.
